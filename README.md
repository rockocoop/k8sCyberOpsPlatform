# k8sCyberOpsPlatform

This repo is dedicated to creating a k8s platform integrated framework for CyberOps.

The goal here is to create a consolidated framework of tools that can be easily deployed on k8s and used for blue/red hat 
activities with the goal of easing the adoption of effective cyber defense and offense in organizations.

## Focus
In other feilds, such as DevOps and Machine Learinging environments, there are trends and directions regarding platforms that can be 
worked on in the community to enhance the common user's experience and ability to advance.  With the advant of k8s as the leading cloud 
platform, and as in Kiali linux, I believe there should be a consolidated community effort to do the following:
- consolidate a list of the common tools
- collaborate in the advancement of cyber efforts as is done today in the community
- develop an easy to use k8s native frontend platform that allows for easy adoption of tools and methods

To be clear, this is NOT a k8s testing tool necessarily.  The goal here is to bring the tools to the next level
in a consolidated and easy to adopt manner in the dominant k8s environments used today, utilizing the platforms
abilities in comparison to traditional platforms and methods.
